<p>What is Stock Photography?<br />
Every day you see thousands of images in magazines, packaging, posters, online and on TV. But very few of these images were created specifically for that product, promotion or concept - what you're seeing is stock photography. Stock photos are ready-made images that are licensable for use in your advertising or promotional materials to illustrate specific things, concepts or ideas. Dreammultimedia's images, media and design elements are just the beginning - they are the raw materials to get your graphic design started.
